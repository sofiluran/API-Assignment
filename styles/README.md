# API ASSIGNMENT

Welcome to our API project!
In this project we have created a webpage that retrieves data from an external API using modern JavaScript practices.
The goal is to demonstrate our understanding of JSON, working with APIs, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript.<br>

We have created 3 seperate API's containing 50 movies. One Christmas themed, one Halloween themed and one Valentine's day themed.
